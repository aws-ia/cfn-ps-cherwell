## Cherwell Service Management connector on the AWS Cloud


This Quick Start deploys the Cherwell Service Management connector on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.

Cherwell Service Management is a powerful, flexible IT service management (ITSM) tool that enables IT teams to implement, automate, and modernize service and support processes to meet new and evolving needs, at a fraction of the cost and complexity associated with legacy ITSM tools. 
The Cherwell Service Management connector creates a reliable and fault-tolerant integration point between your AWS account and your Cherwell Service Management system.

The highly available, serverless Quick Start architecture extends your current IT management and asset tracking process into your AWS account, to provide compliance, governance, and auto-remediation. 
By launching this Quick Start in your AWS environment, you will be able to deploy AWS Service Catalog products, monitor AWS resources, and run AWS Systems Manager Automation documents (SSM Automation documents) from your Cherwell Service Management system.
